# **Mission 1 :  Python-Email ðŸ“§ **

## Summary 
The task was to write a python code using the SMTP library so that I can send an email using the script written.
I have explored a few methods and have test-and-tried the different codes.

### File : Mission 1.1
There is a need to find out email provider SMTP settings. Change the security feature accordingly.

        #1 python_email
        A python script to send an email with body content only
        
        #2 python_email
        More extensive code as compared to previous. 
        Including how to add an image attachment in the email that will be sent out
        
### File : Mission 1.2
        
        #1 track_email
        With the help of a third-party app (Pastepixel), return with info on whether the recipient has opened the email.
